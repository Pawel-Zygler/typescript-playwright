Define top 3 most important features:
1. Shopping Cart and Checkout
2. Login and authentication
3. Product Browsing and Selection

Define top 3 least important features:
1. Footer and social media
2. About section in sidemenu
3. Sorting products



For Shopping Cart and Checkout:

Functional Testing: Verify that all features, including the display of images, titles, prices of products, cart updates, and the checkout process, work as expected.
Integration Testing: Ensure that system components, such as the product database and the order processing system, work seamlessly together.
Performance Testing: Assess how the system performs under heavy load, such as many users simultaneously adding products to their shopping carts.
Security Testing: Confirm that the purchasing process is secure, especially when handling payment data and user authentication.

Depending on the project's needs, I will automate repetitive tasks, especially those crucial for regression. Scenarios that are less tedious or more complex, such as third-party integrations, will remain manual.



For Login Authentication and user data

Login Correctness Testing: Ensure that the system properly allows access with valid credentials and denies access with invalid ones.
Security Testing: Implement measures to ensure that authentication data are secure and not susceptible to common attacks such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
Error Handling Testing: Test how the system behaves when incorrect login data is entered, including any account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed attempts.
Password Recovery Testing: Verify the effectiveness and security of the password recovery process.
Cross-environment Testing: Ensure that the login process functions correctly across different browsers and devices.

Also, validate correctness/incorrectnes user data (first, last names and address) cannot make it to checkout to avoid incomplete orders. Can be easily automated usually.




For Product Browsing and Selection:

UI/UX Testing: Ensure that all user interface elements, such as product lists, are displayed correctly and are interactive.
Visual Testing: Automate tests for loading product images and details, and use tools and techniques for visual regression testing, such as for misplacement of buttons.
Responsiveness Testing: Confirm that the product page adjusts correctly to different screen sizes and devices.
Browser Compatibility Testing: I will ensure that the product browsing and selection feature functions flawlessly across different web browsers.
Filter and Search Testing: Test that the search and filter functions for products work correctly and return the expected results.
